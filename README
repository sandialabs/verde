This README file contains -- BUILDING VERDE, USING VERDE, and 
  CUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS.


BUILDING VERDE:

1. The MACHINE_TYPE environment variable needs to be set for the
   verdict library to build.  Verdict uses VERDICT.x files to control
   its build.

   where the valid values of x are:

   Solaris:  ss
   DEC:      da
   HP:       hp
   SGI:      sg
   Linux:    lin

   In order to select the correct machine control file, the environment
   variable MACHINE_TYPE will need to be set to the proper value:

   setenv MACHINE_TYPE ss  (or the appropriate value)

2. This software requires the exodusII include files and libraries to link.
   If these are not available, send e-mail to rjmeyer@sandia.gov to obtain
   copies.

3. This software required Qt by trolltech.  Correct setup of Qt will make
   verde build succesfully.  This includes QTDIR, and QMAKESPEC.

4. change to the directory containing the verde code and makefiles.

5. create a blank verde.local file:

% touch verde.local

6. make the executable:

% make

7.  For windows, there are project files and a workspace included.

USING VERDE:
   A users manual is included in this release.  It is found in the doc directory.


CUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS:

   The makefile system works on qmake by trolltech.

   The makefile is, by default, configured to produce an optimized build of verde
   and to link with a non-threaded qt library.

   The verde.local file accepts any syntax that qmake understands.  For more options
   not included in here, consult the qmake documentation.

   Doing "make depend" is not necessary since qmake will handle that.

   To clean all:
     % make clean_all

   To clean the base dir (including MDB):
     % make clean

   To clean the GUI dir from the base dir:
     % make cleanGUI

   To clean the GUI dir in the GUI dir:
     % make clean

   To clean the MDB:
     % make cleanMDB
 
   To clean the help dir in the base dir:
     % make cleanHELP

   To clean the help dir in the help dir:
     % make clean

   To make a debug build,  add the following line to your verde.local file.
     CONFIG += debug

   To add a compiler flag:
     QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += MyFlag

   To add a define:
     DEFINES += MY_DEFINE

   To add a linker flag:
     QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += MyFlag

   To add a library to link with:
     LIBS += -Ldir_to_lib -llibname

   Other options available are scoping the options to particular platforms and/or
   particular parts of verde (MDB, GUI, etc...).  Consult the qmake docs for additional
   information.  For example:

   verde_EXE:CONFIG += debug
   verde_GUI:CONFIG += debug
   verde_MDB:CONFIG += release
   ss5_vplatform:verde_EXE:TARGET = myVerde

   will build the base executable and the GUI portion with debug symbols but the MDB
   will be a release build.  The resultant verde executable will be named myVerde on the SUN.
