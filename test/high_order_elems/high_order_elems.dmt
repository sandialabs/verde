Name:
     high_order_elems 

Purpose:
      Tests Verde's ability to treat high order elements no differently than lower order elements.
   
Description:
     This test tests basically makes sure that verde only computes the same metrics for high order elements 
      as it does for corresponding lower order elements.  Verde should use the following node for it's analysis:
         -first 2 nodes for analyizing beams  
         -first 2 nodes for analyizing bars
         -first 8 nodes for analyizing hexes 
         -first 4 nodes for analyizing quads 
         -first 4 nodes for analyizing shells 
         -first 4 nodes for analyizing tets 
         -first 3 nodes for analyizing tris 

Inputs:
   
      NOTE:  All commands use the "-batch" flag to execute.  This is done inside verd_test.

      NOTE:  No other flags are used in this test.
