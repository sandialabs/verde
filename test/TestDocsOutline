Example Documentation for a flag_help test

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Name:

	flag_help


Purpose:

	The purpose of this test is to make sure the -help 
	flag works correctly.

Description:

	We test the -help option by invoking verde with the -help 
	option and compare the output with the desired output.

Inputs:

	command: verde -help
 
	flags: -help
        	we want to see the verde help
 
	mesh file: none

Outputs:

	The output with the -help option should generate a list
	of all the possible command line options that can be
	used when invoking verde.

Pass/Fail Criteria:
 
	If we get a list of command line options, our test
	passes.  Otherwise, it failed.
