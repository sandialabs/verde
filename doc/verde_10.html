<h3>File Menu</h3>
<p>The File menu provides standard file manipulation capabilities for 
loading an Exodus II file into Verde, reading and recording journal 
files and ending journal file recording, printing, capturing screen 
images, saving a model to Exodus II format,
<sup><a HREF="verde_29.html#footnote-1">1</a></sup>
and exiting the program.
<h4><A NAME="open_mesh">Open Mesh</a></h4>

<p>If Verde is invoked without the optional file name, a blank screen is 
displayed and the user must select a model using the File/Open Mesh 
dialog as shown in figure <a HREF="#2">*</a>.
<p><HR >  <div align="center">
    <img hspace=3 src="images/file_open.jpg">
    <div align="center">Verde Open Mesh dialog.</div>
    <A NAME="2">&nbsp;</A>
  </div>
<p>     
<HR ><p>The Open Mesh dialog includes an option that allows the user to select 
blocks to be imported from the Exodus II file. The block 
selection dialog lists the blocks that are defined in the Exodus II file 
and the element type for each block. Verde considers the imported 
blocks "active".  Only active blocks are displayed in the graphics 
region and considered during metrics and topology calculations.
<p>If there is an existing model in Verde 2.6, an additional checkbox
will appear labeled "Add Mesh."  This will allow additional models to
be added into the existing model.  When models are concatenated, the
original element and node ids are replaced with new global ids.
<p>When the mesh has been imported, the skin of the model is displayed in 
the viewing region as shown in figure <a HREF="#3">*</a>.
<p>Verde always remembers the previous directory from which a file was 
selected and opens any subsequent file dialog boxes to this previous directory. 
If no previous directory exists, as when Verde is first invoked, the first file 
dialog defaults to the directory from which Verde is running, "./". 
<p><HR >  <div align="center">
    <img hspace=3 src="images/model_screen.jpg">
    <div align="center">Model skin displayed in hidden line mode.</div>
    <A NAME="3">&nbsp;</A>
  </div>
     

<h4><A NAME="play_journal">Play Journal File</a></h4>

<p>The Play Journal File option brings up a file open dialog that allows 
the user to select a journal file and replay a set of predefined Verde 
commands that are stored in that file.  
<p>Appendix C gives a description of the commands used in a journal file.
<h4><A NAME="record_journal">Record Journal File</a></h4>

<p>The Record Journal File option brings up a file save dialog that allows 
the user to specify a file to save the commands used during a Verde 
session.  As soon as this file is opened, all journal commands are 
written into this file.  Note that most graphics manipulation commands 
are not supported in journal files in Verde version 2.6.
<h4><A NAME="stop_journal">End Record Journal File</a></h4>

<p>This option stops the journaling process.  No additional commands are 
written to the specified journal file.
<h4><A NAME="save_mesh">Save Mesh</a></h4>

<p>The save mesh command saves the currently active blocks, sidesets, and
nodesets to an Exodus II file.
<h4><A NAME="save_image">Save Image As</a></h4>

<p>This menu item allows the user to save the currently displayed view as 
a PNG or JPEG image file.  An extension (either .png or .jpg) 
will be appended to the file name if 
the extension doesn't already exist.  These image formats can be imported 
into many display and manipulation programs including the Microsoft 
Office Suite<i><sup>TM</sup></i>.
<h4><A NAME="print">Print</a></h4>

<p>The print option brings up a print dialog and 
allows the user to print the currently 
displayed image or save the print image to a file.  This method 
currently prints a raster display of the image, so some degradation of 
image quality may occur due to the printer resolution.  
<p>If the image is displayed on the default black background, a message 
box is displayed that allows the selection of a white background.  If 
the user clicks yes in this message box the display region will 
momentarily flash with a white background.  The image will then be 
printed in the current line color and a white background.
<p>Note:  Verde 2.6 does not currently provide a method of printing the 
results of metrics or topology calculation.   To print this data, the 
user must select and cut the desired information from the Command Line 
window and paste it into a separate application (the editor or word 
processor of choice) for printing.
<h4><A NAME="exit">Exit</a></h4>

<p>Exits Verde. If Save Settings on Exit toggle (see section <a HREF="verde_11.html#preferences">*</a>) 
is on, Verde saves settings information out to file, otherwise no state 
or data is saved.
