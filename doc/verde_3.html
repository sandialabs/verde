<h2>Types of Verification</h2>

<p>Verde 2.6 performs mesh verification in three areas:
<ol><li>
<i>Individual Element Metrics</i>. The individual characteristics 
of each element are verified by calculating common metrics depending 
on the element type. Verde calculates one or more metrics for each element 
type supported.  For each metric, the minimum, maximum, average, and standard 
deviation of each metric are tracked, as well as the elements at which 
the minimum and maximum occur.  All elements whose metric values fall 
outside the user-definable acceptable range are flagged as failed. 

<li>
<i>Topology Checks.</i> The topology of the mesh is carefully 
analyzed, looking for any defects in the mesh connectivity or continuity 
that would invalidate the mesh.  Verde reports the number of exterior 
entities for the mesh, checks for manifold topology, and if the
object is manifold, calculates the 
Euler number and infers the probable overall topology.
In addition, it checks for adjoining
quadrilateral faces in the mesh that share only three nodes.

<li>
<i>Interface Checks.</i> The exterior surface of the mesh is 
carefully analyzed.  Exterior elements are checked for 
coincidence.  In this way, potential problems such as incorrect mesh 
joins and multiply-meshed regions can be detected.  
In batch mode, an optional output file can be created 
(in Exodus II format) which contains 
information from the analysis such as the exterior skin of the mesh, 
inferred model edges, and failed elements.  This file can be read by 
Verde in the interactive mode or other tools that read Exodus II data
to establish orientations and locations 
of bad elements and to explore and understand how to improve the current 
mesh.

<li>
<i>Quads Sharing Three Nodes.</i> Hexahedral elements and Quadrilateral elements
are checked to see if any faces of Hexahedral elements or Quadrilaterals share 
three nodes with another face of a Hexahedral element or Quadrilateral.
The check may optionally be performed on the exterior mesh, or on the entire mesh.
