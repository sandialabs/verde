This documentation was created and is maintained with
Hyperlatex.  The single file for all modifications is
verde.tex.  This file can be processed using latex to
create a hardcopy document or hyperlatex to create 
HTML documentation.

For more information on hyperlatex see 

 http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~otfried/Hyperlatex/

Note that the one bad thing about hyperlatex is that
I have to generate two versions of the images.
One in JPEG format for HTML and one in EPS format
for LaTex.  I used jpeg2eps to encapsulate the
original JPEG files.  

To download jpeg2ps see

http://www.pdflib.com/jpeg2ps/

Typing make in the doc directory will create the
EPS versions of the images, create a postscript
version of the document, verde.ps, and generate
the HTML files for the online version of the
document.

The table of contents (verde_toc.xml) and the index 
(verde.idx) for the verde_help application are 
currently generated by hand from the verde_toc.html 
file.  Look at the format of the .xml and the .idx
files to determine the changes that need to be made.
